\begin{abstract}
Cloud offers high computational resources, strong scalability, as well as easy to access. 
Such cloud environment offers these who have limited local computational resources a opportunity to
run large scale applications.
Current data intensive large scale applications generate TB intermediate data shared among hundreds
of compute nodes, so the shared storage throughput becomes critical part.
However compare to the throughput in HPC system, the shared storage
system in cloud environment can only achieve a quite low I/O throughput, becoming the
performance bottleneck for data intensive applications.
Furthermore, according to normal cloud pay-as-you-go pricing, longer execution time means more you
should pay.
In this paper, we propose a cloud based burst
buffer system as a new tier in cloud storage system to absorb I/O request.
We use several nodes as a burst buffer nodes, take advantage of high throughput inside cloud to
buffer application I/O data.
We implemented a prototype of our proposal architecture, evaluated in Amazon EC2/S3(one of the most
common public cloud today).
We shows our system can achieve a significant improvement in I/O throughput for shared storage
in cloud computing through experimental and simulational evaluation.
