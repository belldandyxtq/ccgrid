\begin{abstract}
Cloud offers high computational resources, strong scalability, as well as easy to access. 
Such cloud environment offers these who have limited local computational resources a opportunity to
run large scale applications.
However compare to the throughput between the compute nodes inside cloud, the shared storage
system in cloud environment can only achieve a quite low throughput, becoming the critical
performance bottleneck for data incentive applications.
Furthermore, according to normal cloud pay-as-you-go pricing, longer execution time means more you
should pay.
In this paper, we propose a cloud based burst
buffer system as a new tier in cloud storage system to absorb I/O request.
We use several nodes as a burst buffer nodes, take advantage of high throughput inside cloud to
buffer application I/O data.
We implemented a prototype of our proposal architecture, evaluated in Amazon EC2/S3(one of the most
common public cloud today).
We shows our architecture can achieve a high throughput.
