	author = {Tudoran, Radu and Costan, Alexandru and Wang, Rui and Boug{\'e}, Luc and Antoniu, Gabriel},
			    abstract = {{Today's continuously growing cloud infrastructures provide support for processing ever increasing amounts of scientific data. Cloud resources for computation and storage are spread among globally distributed datacenters. Thus, to leverage the full computation power of the clouds, global data processing across multiple sites has to be fully enabled. However, managing data across geographically distributed datacenters is not trivial as it involves high and variable latencies among sites which come at a high monetary cost. In this work, we propose a uniform data management system for scientific applications running across geographically distributed sites. Our solution is environment aware, as it monitors and models the global cloud infrastructure, and offers predictable data handling performance for transfer cost and time. In terms of efficiency, it provides the applications with the possibility to set a tradeoff between money and time and optimizes the transfer strategy accordingly. The system was validated on Microsoft's Azure cloud across the 6 EU and US datacenters. The experiments were conducted on hundreds of nodes using both synthetic benchmarks and the real life A-Brain application. The results show that our system is able to model and predict well the cloud performance and to leverage this into efficient data dissemination. Our approach reduces the monetary costs and transfer time by up to 3 times.}},
