\section{conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a cloud based burst buffer system to burst the I/O throughput in cloud.
We implement a prototype of our proposal system, and evaluate it on Amazon EC2/S3 public cloud.
We achieve an up to 8 times speed up for a single user in reading, as well as 14 times speed
up for the whole system in writing.
We also simulate three data intensive applications on our proposal system, and achieved up to 4
times speed up on the execution time.

However since this is a prototype of our proposal system, there are still many limitation in the
system, may leading to under utilization of node bandwidth, and master node may easily become the
bottleneck of the whole system.
Also there are many points can be improved and can be added to the implementation, including the
data layout of the I/O node in order to make load balance, and dynamic load balance in node addition
and deletion.
For the future work, we will try to improve our prototype.
