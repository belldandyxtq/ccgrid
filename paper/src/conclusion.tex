\section{conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have explored a cloud-based burst buffer system for clouds.
To investigate the effectiveness of burst buffers in clouds,
we have implement a prototype of our proposal system, and evaluate it on Amazon
EC2/S3 public cloud.
The experimental results show that we can achieve an up to 3 times speed up for
read, and 4 times speed up for write.
We have also conducted simulations targeting three real data
intensive applications, and achieved 2.5 times speed up in the execution time
of a real application, Montage, which has high temporal I/O locality and I/O
time.

As future work, we will extend the system to be able to dynamically change the
number of burst buffer nodes depending on the I/O workloads to achieve high I/O
throughput while minimizing the costs.
