\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a cloud based burst buffer system to burst the I/O throughput in cloud.
We implement a prototype of our proposal system, and evaluate it on Amazon EC2/S3 public cloud.
We also simulate three data intensive applications on our proposal system.
We achieve a up to a up to 8 times speed up for a single user in reading, as well as 14 times speed
up for the whole system in writing.
