\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
	\item cloud provides high computational resource, however data sharing throughput shared storage, can be a performance bottleneck in cloud based high performance computing
	\item 
	\item we purpose a cloud based burst buffer to burst IO throughput between compute node and shared storage in cloud computation.
	\item
